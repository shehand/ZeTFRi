# ZeTFRi

This repository contains the major implementations of the ZeTFRi approach.

1. computeModelQuality.py - Contains the python implementation for the model quality calculation based on the loss difference on adjecent federated rounds.
2. DAGMMModel.py - Contians the python implementation for the DAGMM model as well as relevant helper functions to help the DAGMM model funtions.
3. freeRiders.py - Contains the python implementation for,
    - Advanced Delta Weights Attack
    - Additive Noising Attack

    As well as this file includes the free rider detection algorithm according to the proposed approach.
4. utilsFunctions.py - Contains the python implementation for helper functions.
